# MolecularBiotech_EcoliGrowth
Python-based analysis of E. coli microplate growth data across multiple temperatures. Course project for KETN20 Molecular Biotechnology, Lund University.

**Python-based analysis of *E. coli* microplate growth data across multiple temperatures.**  
Course project for **KETN20 Molecular Biotechnology**, Lund University.  


## 📌 Project Overview
This project investigates how temperature (27–45 °C) affects the growth of *Escherichia coli* K12 NCM3722 in minimal medium with glucose.  
Growth was monitored in microplates and measured as optical density (OD) every 10 minutes.  


## 📊 Dataset
